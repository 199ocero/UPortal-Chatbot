# UPortal Website

Propose Project: uPortal
Problem: Students that have no internet connection (not enough money to buy load)

# What is UPortal

- First of all, we came up with this idea to address the said problem. We use the messenger as a platform to our chatbot which is the uPortal. Why  messenger? Most of the students uses messenger to relay messages from day to day bases. You can use messenger for free, for example, after you download the app you can use this even when you are free data. The downside is that you can't view the images or the videos. With this, we have taken an advantage of the free data access. Teachers can use the other side of this chatbot which is the website of the school. This website will give the teachers a chance to send their announcement, activities, and etc. The data that have gathered will be sent to database and this chatbot will access that database and send this through messenger chabot which is the uPortal. Now then the students that have no internet but have a free access to messenger can view the announcements, what activities to be pass and etc. The only time that they can use the internet is to download the resources of course sent by uPortal example the pdf's, docs, and etc. Instead of spending money for internet they can use this for other stuffs.
