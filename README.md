# UPortal
We have a project proposal and we call this as “uPortal” (University Portal). How does uPortal work? This uPortal is a messenger chatbot and it consists of certain features like checking student information, checking student grades, announcements for every subject, activities, quizzes and more available options. If there is a specific platform that the school uses (i.e USTEP in USTP), we will integrate this chatbot to that platform. The instructors can post their announcements, quizzes, activities, assignments, lectures, etc. on any website or platform that the school uses and this uPortal chatbot will access all the information on that website. The students on the other hand can directly access everything on the platform that the school implements but they can also use the uPortal to view any information or use the features of this uPortal. The purpose of this uPortal is to address the common problem that the students usually have in this new normal like problems with the internet connection. Since a messenger chatbot can be access without a data promo, it wouldn’t be a hassle for students to check if there are announcements etc.
